# Kaggle-Project---Home-Credit-Deafult-Risk

This is a final project from Digital Skola - Data Science Bootcamp. In this project, me and my team were asked to build a machine learning model to predict the capability of home credit's client of repaying the loan.
Hopefully after we built the model we can shorten the flow of home credit's loan assessment team from checking a lot of application.
